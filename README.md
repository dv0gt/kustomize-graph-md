# kustomize-graph

kustomize-graph is a small application that will generate a dependency graph of your kustomize structure.

## Usage

kustomize-graph outputs a graph in DOT. To visualize a DOT graph, [graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) is recommended.

After installing, a graph can be generated by piping the output of kustomize-graph into DOT.

```
kustomize-graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

NOTE: You should run kustomize-graph in the same working directory as you would run kustomize.


## Example

Simplest

Given the following file structure

> ```
> ~/app
> ├── kustomization.yaml
> └── foo
>     ├── kustomization.yaml
>     └── foo-namespace.yaml
> ```

Would result in the following dependency graph
